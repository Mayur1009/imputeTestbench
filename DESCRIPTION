Title: Test Bench for Missing Data Imputing Models/Methods Comparison
Version: 2.1.2
Description: Provides a Test bench for comparison of missing
    data imputation models/methods. It compares imputing methods with reference
    to RMSE, MAE or MAPE parameters. It allows to add new proposed methods to test
    bench and to compare with other methods. The function 'append_method()' allows
    to add multiple numbers of methods to the existing methods available in test bench.
